# Rolan's Productivity Scripts

This is a series of scripts that I use personally to help me manage my productivity.
Feel free to take a look to my deeper thoughs :)

All the scripts are developed in Rust and contains a dockerfile to be deployed as a single containerized application.

The repository contains a development container that can be used to develop the scripts.
